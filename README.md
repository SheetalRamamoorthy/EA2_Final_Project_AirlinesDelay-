"2015 FLIGHT DELAYS & CANCELLATIONS ”

To perform the Exploratory Data Analysis and to predict if the given set of flights’ arrival will be delayed or not using the response variable “Arrival Delay” is the idea of the project.

Motivation 

Flight delays have always been one of the important problems in association with the management of airport and changes in flights schedules which affects the passengers the most.
We know for a fact that if we are late out of the driveway in the morning we will be late to work, and at times it costs us the whole day. Think about the people who travel on air and what the delay in flight’s arrival would cost them.
By predicting if the flights will be delayed or not with the help of the information we know in advance, like the departure information, flight information etc. will give the passengers a heads up on which airline they should fly to avoid significant delays.
